## Who am I?

I am a third-year student at *University of California - San Diego (UCSD)* with an intended major in *Computer Engineering*. **I am seeking an internship in the software industry.**

Take a look at my [RESUME](Resume.pdf)

## How I describe myself:

I am passionate about improving programming skills through hands-on experience and solving problems. I am a caring, organized, and hardworking individual who likes to collaborate with others, whether in an academic environment or a workplace. I also pay attention to detail and I am a fast learner. I aim for clear, thorough communication and having a comfortable yet professional interaction with others.

## Extracurricular activities:

- **Group Leader**, Computer Science & Engineering Early Research Scholars Program (10/2020 - 06/2021)
- **Section Member**, UCSD Society of Women Engineering (02/2021 - Present)
- **Member**, TRIO Student Services Program (10/2019 - Present)
- **Mentee**, Triton Community Leadership Institute (08/2019 - 06/2020)

## My favorite quote:
> *Grant me the **serenity** to accept the things I cannot change, the **courage** to change the things I can, and the **wisdom** to know the difference.* 

## Programming languages I have learned:

``` 
Python 
Java
C/ C++
```

## Projects:

### Non-native English speaking students in Computer Science

***1. Summary:***
   
   In our study, we would like to understand more about the barriers that non-native English speakers face while solving a programming problem. Specifically, we focus on processes like thinking-aloud that are commonly used in programming interviews and the level to which non-native English speakers are able to read and understand programming language documentation written in English.

***2. Research Questions:***
   
- We want to explore if there are any challenges that non-native English speakers face compared to that of native English speakers while talking through their steps for solving a programming problem.
  
- We want to learn if there is a difference in the way non-native English speakers read and understand programming language documentation written in English (e.g., Java Docs) when compared to native English speakers and whether this affects their performance on programming problems.

Please take a look at our [research poster](Research%20Project%20Poster.pdf) after 1 year conducting interviews with students.

## My goals:

### Career:

- [ ] Find an internship at a tech company
- [ ] Learn to write good and maintainable code
- [ ] Learn to test code thoroughly and take time to fully debug everything before publishing these lines of code.
- [ ] Always think about the users‚Äô experiences and the social impact my program can make.
- [ ] Be an ethical software engineer/ programmer.

### Personal

- [ ] Buy a house for my parents üè°
- [ ] Save enough money to travel üèñ
